# About 
This is a React App where users can search for food. This is inspired by the Yelp app. 

# Motivations 
Building this app allowed me to express a couple of my favorite things: Technology and food. This was inspired by the Yelp app, which I think is a pretty cool app that allows users to write reviews of businesses, and help other users connect with businesses. I think it's kind of zen, actually.
